# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis 🚴‍♀️
**Google Data Analytics Capstone Project**

## 📌 Project Overview
[cite_start]As a Junior Data Analyst at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago, I was tasked with analyzing historical trip data to identify trends in how different customer types use bikes[cite: 9].

**The Business Problem:**
[cite_start]The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships[cite: 10]. [cite_start]My goal was to design marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members by understanding their distinct behavioral differences[cite: 12].

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.11
* **Libraries:** Pandas (Data Manipulation), Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization), Glob (File Merging)
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Data Source
[cite_start]I used Cyclistic's historical trip data (Divvy 2019 Q1 and Divvy 2020 Q1)[cite: 66].
* [cite_start]**Data Integrity:** The data was anonymized (no PII) and unbiased[cite: 69].
* **Size:** Processed over 700,000 ride records.

## 🔍 Key Insights
1.  **Weekly Routine:** Annual members act as commuters, with peak usage on weekdays (Mon-Fri). [cite_start]Casual riders act as tourists/leisure users, with peak usage on weekends[cite: 41].
2.  **Ride Duration:** Casual riders have a significantly higher average trip duration compared to members.
3.  **The "Thursday Surprise":** While casual ride volume is highest on weekends, their *longest* rides consistently occur on Thursdays.

## 💡 Recommendations
[cite_start]Based on the analysis, I recommend the following marketing strategies to the executive team[cite: 52]:
1.  **"Weekend Warrior" Membership:** Create a weekend-only membership tier to capture the high volume of casual riders on Saturdays and Sundays.
2.  **"Thirsty Thursday" Promo:** Target casual riders with a discount on annual memberships if they complete a ride over 30 minutes on a Thursday.
3.  **Commuter Incentives:** Offer gamified rewards for casual riders who try commuting during peak weekday hours (7-9 AM).
